title: "What is Dragnet?"
---

## Dragnet is a continuation of the project: https://github.com/iezer/dragnet

The goal of the project is to create a Javascript Web App that will extract specified labels from images for workbook problems including matching, fill-in-the-blank, matching descriptions, etc. from images created in PowerPoint, and create an interactable version where the specified image labels can be dragged to their corresponding place.

The app needs to be able to check if the labels are placed back into their correct location, with the ability to grade and give feedback to the user based on how many they placed correct or incorrectly.

For example, the below image shows a map of Canada with three labels that have been extracted and turned into interactable objects that can be dragged and placed onto the map for a word matching problem.
